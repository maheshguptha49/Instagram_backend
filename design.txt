An activity model is for the news feed because if you want to get likes count for a post or comment you would have to query the likes model every time that would fire a lot of queries so Activity table is needed 

post has userid and body 
Comment has userid , body , its parentId and type of parent
Like has userid , body , its parentid and type of parent
